# Time Series Forecasting of Taco Sales
This repository contains my individual contribution from a larger group project, focusing exclusively on **time series analysis and forecasting** of taco sales data.

It includes the following files:
- `Taco_TimeSeries.ipynb` — Jupyter Notebook with full analysis, visualizations, and forecasting results.  
- `Taco_TimeSeries.py` — Script version of the notebook for a cleaner, software-style implementation.  
- `README.md` — Project description, setup instructions, and documentation. 

## Dataset
- Source: [Kaggle Taco Sales Dataset (2024–2025)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/atharvasoundankar/taco-sales-dataset-20242025/data)  
- License: MIT (see dataset page for details).  

## Methods
The notebook demonstrates:
- Data exploration and preprocessing
- Time series visualization
- Forecasting with Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)
